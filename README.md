# FuturixAlpha

I needed a simple tool to convert various images between PNG format and Windows bitmaps, while preserving alpha channel (for 32-bit images) - so I wrote one!  
Its source is fairly useless due to a dependency on a commercial third-party graphic library - but I thought I'll publish it for preservation.

Tools:  
Delphi 2009  
NSIS
